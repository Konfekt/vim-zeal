This Vim plug-in binds `<F1>` to showing the documentation of the keyword under the cursor in the offline documentation browser [Zeal](http://www.zealdocs.org).
If there's no keyword, hitting `<F1>` shows a documentation entry page

To look up the current keyword in many configuration files in the terminal as well, have a look at [vim-keyword-lookup](https://github.com/Konfekt/vim-keyword-lookup).
